## Notes

# Second generation model: commodities as money  (Kiyotaki and Wright 1989)


There are three agents and three goods. Each good $i$ have a common flow utility $\rho_i$ but each agent obtains an additional utility from the consumption of his preferred good. After consuming his preferred good $i$, he can produce good $i+1$. Agents meet randomly and decide whether to exchange the goods. The trade-off is that when agent $i$ trades and gets $i+2$, it is easier to meet an agent $i+1$ and get the good that $i$ prefers (liquidity).

Assuming good $3$ is useless. There are  many different situations depending on the paramters.
- Fundmanetal equilibrium when $\rho_1>\rho_2$ and $\rho_2>\hat{\rho}_2$. In this equilibrium, good 1 is the universally accpeted money and agent 2 act as the middleman. That is, when agent $1$ meets $2$, he does acquire good $3$, and when agent $3$ meets agent $1$, he does not acquire good $2$ either. But when agent $2$ meets agent $3$, he acquires goods $1$. 
- Speculative equilibrium when $\rho_1>\rho_2$ and $\rho_2<\bar{\rho}_2$ . This equilibirum features   type $1$  agents trading good $2$ for the lower-return  good $3$ to improve their liquidity position,  and both goods $1$ and $3$ are used for indirect exchange.
- When $\rho_2$ is in the middle, there can be mixed equilibrium strategy and even non-stationary strategy that cycles over time.
- When $\rho_2>\rho_1$, there is always a fundamental equilibrium. 

$$\rho=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\rho_i\mathrm{d}i$$
